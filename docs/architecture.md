# OctoFit Tracker architecture

OctoFit Tracker is a three-tier application for a school fitness program. The starter code includes API contracts and intentionally incomplete implementation points so you can use GitHub Copilot agent mode in a test-driven loop.

![Three-tier OctoFit architecture](../.github/images/octofit-architecture.svg)

## Tier boundaries

- **Presentation tier**: React 19, Vite, React Router, Bootstrap, and a shared API client in `octofit-tracker/frontend/src`.
- **Logic tier**: Express and TypeScript routes/services in `octofit-tracker/backend/src` expose `/api/*` behavior on port `8000`.
- **Data tier**: Mongoose models and seed data in `octofit-tracker/backend/src/models` and `src/scripts/seed.ts` persist to MongoDB on port `27017`.

## Ports and environment rules

- MongoDB: `27017`
- Express API: `8000`
- Vite frontend: `5173`
- The browser calls relative `/api` paths. Vite proxies them to `http://localhost:8000`, so the unauthenticated API port stays private in Codespaces. `VITE_API_BASE_URL` can override the base URL.

## API contract

| Capability | Method and path | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity tracking | `GET /api/activities`, `POST /api/activities` | List and create valid activity records. POST accepts `userId`, `teamId`, `type`, and `minutes`; `userId` and `teamId` must be well-formed IDs for an existing user and team; otherwise respond with a deliberate 4xx (never a 500 from a cast error). A created activity stores the submitted `user`, `team`, `type`, and `minutes` plus computed `points` and `occurredAt`. |
| Teams | `GET /api/teams`, `POST /api/teams` | List and create teams with members. Created and listed teams keep the submitted `name` and `mascot`. Reject a team without a name with `400`. |
| Leaderboard | `GET /api/leaderboard` | Return teams ordered by the sum of their activity points, highest first. Each entry has `teamName`, `totalPoints`, and a 1-based `rank`. |
| Workout suggestions | `GET /api/workouts/suggestions/:userEmail` | Recommend workouts from recent activity patterns for the matching seeded user's email address. The first suggestion's `focus` matches that user's goal or recent activity, with a `reason` explaining why. An email with no matching user returns a deliberate 4xx (for example, `404`). |

## Implementation decisions

The implementation will preserve the existing three-tier boundaries and use the
contract tests as the acceptance criteria.

- Presentation tier decision: Keep route-level capability components focused on
	rendering and user states. Use `src/api/client.ts` for relative API requests,
	and show accessible loading, empty, success, and error states.
- Logic tier decision: Keep request handling in the `/api` router and business
	rules in explicit service functions. Validate request data and references
	before persistence, and convert expected failures to deliberate 4xx responses.
- Data tier decision: Put required fields, defaults, references, and basic value
	validation in Mongoose schemas. Keep seed records stable and idempotent with
	upserts while preserving unrelated data.
- Activity tracking approach: Validate `userId` and `teamId`, verify both
	records exist, calculate points from the submitted activity, and persist the
	activity with its creation timestamp.
- Team management approach: Validate the team name and mascot, default members
	to an empty array, preserve submitted members, and return created/listed teams
	with their member references.
- Leaderboard approach: Aggregate activity points by team, join team names,
	sort totals descending, and assign ranks starting at one.
- Workout suggestions approach: Find the user by email, use the fitness goal
	and recent activity to choose matching workouts, and attach a reason. Return
	a 4xx response when no user matches.

## Test plan

Run the focused checks in dependency order, then run both builds. A data-tier
failure indicates a schema, default, reference, or seed-contract problem. An
API failure indicates service behavior, request validation, response shape, or
error-status handling. A frontend failure indicates a route rendering,
API-client, accessibility-state, or user-facing empty/error-state problem. A
build failure indicates a TypeScript or bundling issue in that tier.
